# REST APIs LUX
The REST APIs provide programmatic access to read Transport for Luxembourg data. Read carpark occupancy data, upcoming bus/train departures from a stop point, and more. All responses are in JSON format.

If your intention is to monitor or process our data in real-time, consider using the [Streaming APIs](/docs/StreamingAPIs.md) instead.

## Overview
Below are some documents that will help you get going with the REST APIs as quickly as possible:

- [GET StopPoint](/docs/RESTAPIs/StopPoint.md) (Get Stoppoints in Luxembourg)
- [GET StopPoint/Departures](/docs/RESTAPIs/StopPoint/Departures.md) (Get Stoppoints in Luxembourg)
- [BikePoint](/docs/RESTAPIs/StopPoint.md) (Get Stoppoints in Luxembourg)

## Feedback and next steps
If you find any issues with the REST API, please use our discussion forums where we’ll be actively listening to your feedback. We look forward to working with you, and can’t wait to see what everyone builds!
