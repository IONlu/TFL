# Occupancy
The following [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API endpoints offer access to the occupation status of carparks data flowing through Transport for Luxembourg.
Currently we're providing data from [Ville de Luxembourg](https://data.public.lu/en/organizations/ville-de-luxembourg/)'s car parks only. We hope to be able to integrate occupancy of buses running in Luxembourg city soon.
