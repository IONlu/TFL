# Streaming APIs
The Streaming APIs provide programmatic access to real time Transport for Luxembourg data. Get updates of carpark occupancy data, bus/train departures from a stop point, and more. All responses are in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format.

## Getting started
To make things easy for you, we have published a streaming API client on npmjs 👉🏽 [tfl-api-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tfl-api-client).
Just subscribe to the channel(s) you want to get the data from and create magical apps 🎉.

## Channels
Below are some documents that will help you get going with the Streaming APIs as quickly as possible:


## Feedback
If you find any issues with the Streaming API, please notify us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TfLlu) or [email](mailto:tfl@ion.lu) where we’ll be actively listening to your feedback. We look forward to working with you, and can’t wait to see what everyone builds!
